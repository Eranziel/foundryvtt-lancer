# Experimentation of Beacon System for FoundryVTT
An experimentation attempt of a Beacon VTT system for the [Beacon RPG](https://pirategonzalezgames.itch.io/beacon-playtest) by [Pirate Gonzalez Games](https://www.pirategonzalezgames.com/), just for messing around within my friend group.

A list of tasks being attempted will be available in issues, however I make no promises as to the continued development and maintenance of this project as I do not actually even know much about either Lancer or Beacon, and am just involved as a hobby.

## Attribution and Acknowledgements
The Beacon universe and all related setting materials belong to Pirate Gonzalez Games. I have not actually asked for permission and have no idea if I should, but do not think anyone will ever see this.

This project incorporates several resources and open source software (either in part or in whole). Without these, this project would be much poorer, and might not even exist in the first place. A huge thank you to all those who use their time and skills to enrich the world with their creations!

* Some icons are adapted from Font Awesome - see [Icon Attributions](dist/assets/icons/ATTRIBUTION.md).
* [lancer-data](https://github.com/massif-press/lancer-data), a JSON library of Lancer content.
* [Foundry Project Creator](https://gitlab.com/foundry-projects/foundry-pc) by NickEast, without which this project would have taken much longer to find its feet!

Additionally, a huge thank you and shout out to Animu36, Staubz, and Grygon for their help getting the alpha release brought up to speed and out the door!
