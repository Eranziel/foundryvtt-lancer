# Lancer System for FoundryVTT

A Foundry VTT system for the [Lancer RPG](https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf) by [Massif Press](https://massif-press.itch.io/).

**CAUTION:** Lancer is now compatible with Foundry v10. If you launch your Lancer worlds on v10, Foundry will automatically migrate your data and make it incompatible with v9. **_Always always always_** back up your data before updating Foundry!
