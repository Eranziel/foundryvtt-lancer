# 2.0.0 (2024-06-02)

_IT'S FINALLY HERE!_

This update to the system has been a long labour of love for myself and the rest of the team. Of course this includes long-awaited support for Foundry v11, but also a large refactor of the bones of the system. Largely this will be invisible to you as users, but it will make for easier maintenance of the system, development of modules to support Lancer, and expansions of the system automation. We hope you all enjoy!

Here is a summary of the changes, though in any refactor this large some items will get missed.

## Features

- #577 - Support for Foundry v11! We recommend using the latest stable version, 11.315+.
- #429 - The system's data model has been migrated away from the bespoke `machine-mind` library, now using Foundry's standardized `DataModel` framework. This will make future development, maintenance, module development, and macro writing much easier and Foundry-standard.
- #412 - Bond support! We now fully support the Bonds system, introduced in "Field Guide to the Karrakin Trade Baronies". Bond items can be added to Pilot actors. This includes some light automation for tallying XP. You can also select Stress and XP as token bar resources on pilot tokens.
- System automation rework. We designed and implemented a framework we call `Flows` for handling automation sequences, which is designed to be flexible and extensible. This will make adding to the automation in the future easier, as well as allow module developers to make targeted alterations to the automation, or even replace entire Flows wholesale. We are very excited to see what the community does with these!
- #574 - We now have themes! These echo the themes in Comp/Con and include: GMS Red (default, theme from 1.X and earlier), GMS Dark (same, but with dark background and light text), MSMC Solarized, HORUS Terminal, Harrison Armory Ras Shamra, SSC Constellar Congress, IPS-N Carina, FORECAST/GALSIM.
- #328 - When importing an LCP which includes NPC classes, basic actors for each of those classes are generated inside the "Premade NPCs" compendium.
- #475 - We have added Tours for the main features of the Lancer system.
- #573 - The compendiums have fancy custom banners!
- #580 - The compendiums have been condensed to make use of folders, reducing clutter.
- #496 - Counters on pilot sheets can now be deleted.
- #550 - The create actor dialog defaults to NPC now as it is the most common actor type to create, saving GMs a couple clicks.
- #582 - Lancer's measured templates now properly support gridless scenes.
- #601 - Tokens and prototype tokens automatically have the appropriate size set when the actor's frame or class changes.
- #605 - Carousel Combat Tracker integration.
- #594 - Structure and Overheat results now include a button to roll for Cascade if the mech has a system with the AI tag.
- Added a `fromLidMany` helper for use in chat messages and journals, allowing quick creation of references to Lancer compendium items.
- Removed the Sitrep, Environment, Manufacturer, and Quirk item types. These all either had poor support in the system, or were better served as simple text fields. Sitreps and Environments may see a return as Journals one day.
- Tags have been moved from a compendium of items to a system-level setting. This allows more consistent and tightly-bound behaviour.

## Bug Fixes

- #311 - Tech actions which are not tech attacks no longer trigger an attack roll.
- #324 - The Engineering mech skill no longer gives bonus uses to pilot gear.

- #372 - Re-importing an LCP now updates the relevant items in the compendiums, instead of ignoring them.
- #399 - Dragging a Pilot, Mech, or NPC actor onto a Deployable updates the deployer correctly.
- #403 - Deployable cards shown on pilot and mech sheets now list all of their associated actions correctly, fixing the long-standing issue of Jericho displaying a full action to deploy.
- #416 - Chat message right-click menu is no longer hidden.
- #424 - Removing a class or template from an NPC now also removes all related features.
- #432 - Importing an LCP with special characters in an item ID (e.g. the Störtebeker) now correctly preserves those characters. Importing pilots who use the affected items should now import those items correctly.
- #489 - Pilot armor can now be increased past 1.
- #597 - Mech armor is no longer capped at 4, for all you White Witch pilots.
- #498 - Actions from mech core system actives/passives can now be used properly.
- #513 - dragging a weapon onto an occupied mount slot will now replace the original weapon.
- #524 - Reserves now save categories other than "resources".
- #549 - The Lock On status is now automatically removed from tokens when consumed during a tech attack.
- #581 - Improved the performance of target acquisition when placing Lancer measured templates.

This allows for proper tracking of resources on actor sheets, and if combat automation is enabled in the settings, then this will also tie into the combat roll workflow (Unloaded weapons can't be fired, etc.).

- **Action Manager**: First draft of the action manager. While controlling a token, a (movable) HUD will appear. If you've used Comp/Con's active mode, this will be very similar to the action bar at the bottom right. Currently actions need to be manually spent for actions (When done moving, click the move action button, etc.). The core workflows of the action system is there:
  - When starting a turn, a token's actions are refreshed.
  - When ending a turn, all remaining actions are wasted (minus Reaction, which is immediately refreshed at every turn).
  - When spending a Quick action and a Full action is available, the Full action is spent instead (represents the 2 Quick = 1 Full conversion).
- **Action Editing**: First draft of action editing on all manner of items, first step towards homebrew and ease-of-use UX.
- (0.9.1 but not documented) Right clicking weapon icons will toggle destroyed state. This will eventually be folded into a proper context menu.

# 0.1.0 (2020-07-19)

## Alpha release!

A huge thank you and shout-out to Animu36, Grygon, and Staubz, without whose help this initial release would have taken many more weeks!

The system is bare-bones, but should be stable for play. Features existing as of this release:

- Compendiums containing all of the Core Book player-side content.
- Pilot sheet with sorted Items, mount handling (thanks, Animu!), support for frame swapping by drag-and-drop, and some macro buttons.
- NPC sheet with support for class swapping by drag-and-drop (thanks, Staubz!), and some macro buttons.
- Editable sheets for each Item type (thanks, Grygon!):
  - Skill Triggers
  - Talents
  - Core Bonuses
  - Pilot Armor, Weapons, and Gear
  - Mech Frames
  - Mech Weapons
  - Mech Systems
  - NPC Classes
  - NPC Templates
  - NPC Features

## Recommended Companion Modules

- Lancer Condition Icons - status/condition icon sets tailored towards Lancer.
- Hex Size Support - Improves Hex grid snapping, movement, and ruler measurement for hex tokens larger than size 1.
- Popcorn Initiative - Add-on popcorn initiative management system.

## Known Issues

- Weapons, systems, and NPC features do not render all of their effects yet. Since the Compendiums are generated using `lancer-data` (the same data library that Comp/Con uses), the effects are broken down into the special types that Comp/Con supports. Implementing proper rendering and then editability for special effects types will be added soon. This may be delayed until the recently announced changes to the data are complete on the Comp/Con side.
- No NPCs included! As the Core Book NPCs are part of the paid content for Lancer, they cannot be included in the system upon install. An LCP import tool is coming, which will allow you to use the Comp/Con NPC pack (download from the [Core Book itch.io page](https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf)) to automatically build/update NPC Compendiums. For now, NPC stats will need to be entered manually.
- Does not include [Long Rim](https://massif-press.itch.io/the-long-rim) or Wallflower player content. Again, LCP import is coming!
