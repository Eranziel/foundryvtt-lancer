        <h2>Migration Troubleshooting</h2>

        <p>If the migration seems to never finish, or if it runs every time you
        load Foundry, then most likely it is encountering errors during the
        migration process and not finishing properly. Here are some common
        issues:</p>

        <ul> <li><b>Unlinked tokens inside of scenes inside of compendiums.</b>
        If you have a compendium of old scenes from v10 or earlier, you should:
        <ul><li>import them in your v10 world</li> <li>remove them from the
        compendium</li> <li>migrate to Lancer 2.X/Foundry v11</li> <li>move them
        back to the compendium</li> </ul></li> <li><b>Items of invalid
        types.</b> As detailed in the next page of this journal, the Tag,
        Manufacturer, Sitrep, Environment, Faction, and Quirk item types have
        been deprecated in Lancer 2.0. If you had items of these types in your
        world, they will show up in Settings tab -&gt; Support &amp; Issues
        -&gt; Document Issues. <ul><li>If you wish to get rid of these items,
        you can do so by copying the following code into a new script macro and
        running it, then refreshing the page.
        <code>game.items.invalidDocumentIds.map(id =&gt;
        game.items.getInvalid(id).delete())</code></li> </ul></li> <li><b>Some
        modules can interfere with the migration process.</b> If none of the
        above apply to you, disable all modules and let the migration finish,
        then re-enable your desired modules.</li> </ul>

        <h2>Migration from 1.X - what you need to know</h2>

        <p>The Lancer system has undergone a fairly significant change since the
        1.x versions, including simplifications of most of of the data model, as
        well as the removal of our machine-minds. More importantly, Foundry has
        evolved significantly as a platform, allowing us to do a lot of nice
        cleanup in how we store and work with data. As such, we once again need
        to migrate! Improvements in how Foundry tracks and validates data should
        make this a fairly painless operation.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, your Lancer compendiums will be cleared to prevent
        issues from old data, so you will need to re-import your LCPs. Some
        things are also not fully migratable, so you may need to do a bit of
        reconnecting:</p>

        <ul> <li>Existing mechs may not be set as active mechs for their pilots,
        and will not get HASE bonuses etc... You can set a pilot's active mech
        in the "MECH//ACTIVE" tab on their sheet.</li> <li>Deployables will
        likely lose the link to their deployers, and will need to be
        reconnected.</li><li>Deployable tokens in existing scenes may not be the
        correct size post-migration.</li> </ul>

        <h2>What Happened to All the Compendiums?</h2>

        <p>We have consolidated the Lancer compendiums, making use of the new
        feature of folders within compendiums. They are now grouped by which
        type of actor will use the items in the compendium.</p>

        <p>Also, after lengthy debate, we have trimmed some of the fat in our
        item types. The following item types are now deprecated:</p>

        <ul> <li><code>tag</code>s - which are now tracked via the world
        settings for efficiency and consistency.</li>
        <li><code>manufacturer</code>s - which never really warranted an "item",
        and are now just a string on licensed items.</li>
        <li><code>sitreps</code>s - which were barely supported to begin with,
        and didn't make sense to keep as an item.</li>
        <li><code>environments</code>s - which may see an eventual return, were
        not supported or implemented to our liking.</li>
        <li><code>factions</code>s - which may see an eventual return as a
        journal entry type when those are supported</li>
        <li><code>quirks</code>s - which seemed to fit better as just a text
        box.</li> </ul>
