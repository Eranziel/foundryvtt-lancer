        <h2>Migration Troubleshooting</h2>

        <p>If the migration seems to never finish, or if it runs every time you
        load Foundry, then most likely it is encountering errors during the
        migration process and not finishing properly. Here are some common
        issues:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Unlinked tokens inside of scenes inside of compendiums.</b> If
        you have a compendium of old scenes from v10 or earlier, you should:
        <ul><li>import them in your v10 world</li>
        <li>remove them from the compendium</li>
        <li>migrate to Lancer 2.X/Foundry v11</li>
        <li>move them back to the compendium</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Items of invalid types.</b> As detailed in the next page of this
        journal, the Tag, Manufacturer, Sitrep, Environment, Faction, and Quirk
        item types have been deprecated in Lancer 2.0. If you had items of
        these types in your world, they will show up in Settings tab -> Support
        & Issues -> Document Issues.
        <ul><li>If you wish to get rid of these items, you can do so by copying
        the following code into a new script macro and running it, then
        refreshing the page.
        <code>game.items.invalidDocumentIds.map(id => game.items.getInvalid(id).delete())</code></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Some modules can interfere with the migration process.</b> If
        none of the above apply to you, disable all modules and let the
        migration finish, then re-enable your desired modules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Migration from 1.X - what you need to know</h2>

        <p>The Lancer system
        has undergone a fairly significant change since the 1.x versions,
        including simplifications of most of of the data model, as well as the
        removal of our machine-minds. More importantly, Foundry has evolved
        significantly as a platform, allowing us to do a lot of nice cleanup in
        how we store and work with data. As such, we once again need to migrate!
        Improvements in how Foundry tracks and validates data should make this a
        fairly painless operation.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, your Lancer compendiums
        will be cleared to prevent issues from old data, so you will need to
        re-import your LCPs. Some things are also not fully migratable, so you
        may need to do a bit of reconnecting:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Existing mechs may not
        be set as active mechs for their pilots, and will not get HASE bonuses
        etc... You can set a pilot's active mech in the "MECH//ACTIVE" tab on
        their sheet.</li>
        <li>Deployables will likely lose the link to their
        deployers, and will need to be reconnected.</li><li>Deployable tokens in
        existing scenes may not be the correct size
        post-migration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Happened to All the
        Compendiums?</h2>

        <p>We have consolidated the Lancer compendiums, making
        use of the new feature of folders within compendiums. They are now
        grouped by which type of actor will use the items in the
        compendium.</p>

        <p>Also, after lengthy debate, we have trimmed some of
        the fat in our item types. The following item types are now
        deprecated:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><code>tag</code>s - which are now tracked via the
        world settings for efficiency and
        consistency.</li>
        <li><code>manufacturer</code>s - which never really
        warranted an "item", and are now just a string on licensed
        items.</li>
        <li><code>sitreps</code>s - which were barely supported to
        begin with, and didn't make sense to keep as an
        item.</li>
        <li><code>environments</code>s - which may see an eventual
        return, were not supported or implemented to our
        liking.</li>
        <li><code>factions</code>s - which may see an eventual
        return as a journal entry type when those are
        supported</li>
        <li><code>quirks</code>s - which seemed to fit better as
        just a text box.</li>
        </ul>
