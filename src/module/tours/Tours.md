# LANCER System Tours

Tours is a feature added in Foundry V10 allowing demoing of features. By
including tours for common features, we can hopefully provide a convenient way
for users to learn how to use LANCER system features without them needing to
seek support in Pilot NET.

## Design Goals

In order to maximise the effectiveness of tours they should adhere to a few
design goals.

1. Focused - A tour should showcase only one feature.
2. Brief - A tour should use as few steps as possible.
3. Unique - A tour should not cover information from core foundry tours or the
   foundry knowledge-base.
4. Simple - A tour should cover basic functionality and leave advanced topics
   for wiki pages.
