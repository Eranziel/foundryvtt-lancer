    <p>First, make sure you have your LANCER data imported properly via the compendium manager in the "Compendiums" tab.
      If you have non-core content you want to use in your game, this would be the place to do it as well.</p>
    <p>Next, go to the Actors tab and create any PCs you want to use. You can either import from COMP/CON using the
      RM-4://SYNC tab, or manually build it out yourself. NPCs have to be manually built out for now.</p>
    <p>To manually build out an actor, there are two steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Drag items from the relevant compendiums, such as Mech frames or NPC Features.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Manually adjust numeric stats for any special customizations you want to apply. For NPCs, you would
        do this by editing the actor's NPC Class item. For PC mechs, you can do this by editing their Frame item from
        the mech's Inventory.
