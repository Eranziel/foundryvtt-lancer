  <h2>Basic Workflows</h2>
  <span>
    <p>First, make sure you have your LANCER data imported properly via the compendium manager in the "Compendiums" tab.
      If you have other non-core content you want imported, this would be the place to do it as well.</p>
    <p>Next, go to the Actors tab and create any PCs you want to use. You can either import from COMP/CON using the
      RM-4://SYNC tab, or manually build it out yourself. NPCs have to be manually built out for now.</p>
    <p>To manually build out an actor, there are two steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Drag items from the relevant compendiums, such as Mech frames or NPC Features.</li>
      <li>Manually adjust numeric stats if you have any special customizations you want to apply.</li>
    </ol>
